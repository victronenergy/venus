# Usage tips:
# - working on something, and need that to be built first? Temporarily, insert
#   a stage before the others.
# - to make gitlab skip jobs, prepend its name with . (a dot).
# - gitlab: don't forget to set the builds option to clone instead of git fetch
#   see Project Settings -> Builds. Fixes issues new builds not being 100%
#   clean builds.
# - In Project Settings you can also increase the max build time, default 60
#   minutes, to, for example, 180 minutes.

  # This is often fine though, the native tools hardly change, so lets see if this works.
  # The problem with making this is a seperate stage is that the artifacts (which are
  # rather large) are going to be copied back and forth between the build stages as well)
