# Todo:
# - Add SDK

# Usage tips:
# - working on something, and need that to be built first? Temporarily, insert
#   a stage before the others.
# - to make gitlab skip jobs, prepend its name with . (a dot).
# - don't forget the dependencies: [] setting. It fixes artifacts being passed
#   on from one stage to the next. See note for more info:
#   https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/3423#note_4714661
# - gitlab: don't forget to set the builds option to clone instead of git fetch
#   see Project Settings -> Builds. Fixes issues new builds not being 100%
#   clean builds.
# - In Project Settings you can also increase the max build time, default 60
#   minutes, to, for example, 180 minutes.

  # This stage could be build immediately after the full version, saves time.
  # But that changes things too, the private metas will still be applied.
  # Therefore we do a clean build, making sure that John Doe on the internet
  # can build the image from scratch, and that the result is the same.
